# Tuesday - Functions and data structures

## Before lesson materials

Mandatory:

* [General introduction to functions][1]
* [Introduction to Python built-in data structures][2]
* [Codecademy course on Python functions][4]
* [Codecademy course on Python lists and dictionaries][5]

Optional:

* [Hands-on Python Tutorial: Defining Functions of your Own][3]

## Tasks

### Functions

* Function basics
    * Stateless functions
    * Side effects
    * Recursion
* Exercises:
  Write a function for:
    1. "Say hi" in different languages, defaulting to English
    2. Calculate circumference of a circle
    3. Calculate the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence

### Data structures

* Discuss the importance of data structures
* Implement our very own linked list (led by instructor)
    * Basics
    * Append
    * Insert
    * Remove
* Go over the Python built-in basic data structures
    * List, stack, queue
    * Set
    * Dictionary
* Daily project: fun with lottery numbers
    1. Print the five most frequent numbers and how many times they have occurred
    2. Gather all the individual numbers that were drawn

If there is time left:

* Graphs
* Figure out how to build a binary tree
